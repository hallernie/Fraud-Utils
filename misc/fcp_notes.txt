Keyword Collection:

-- Grouping of media based on a keyword
-- Clips that have a keyword applied will have a "blue" bar across the media
-- Clips with a "purple" bar are those that were analyzed and tagged as "people" during import

-- Note: You can keyword entire, part, and multiple parts of a clip

Smart Collection:

-- Grouping of media based on rules that I define

-- Two types:
---- Library Smart Collections
---- Event Smart Collections




Rating Clips:

-- Two rating possible (Under the "Mark" menu):
---- Favorite (have a "green" bar across the media)
-------- Note: You can favorite entire, part, and multiple parts of a clip

Clip marking:

-- i: Mark an "in" point. The out put will be set to the end of the clip
-- o: Mark an "out" point
-- Option-x: Clear selection ranges

Select a precise range in the browser or the timeline:
-- io+number  <- the "io" places in/out at same position, then "+number" moves the out point
-- io+1200    <- mark in/out point then move out point 12 seconds into the future





Misc:

-- Click on a clip in the browser
---- Ctrl-d     (Shows the duration of the clip in the browser)
---- Ctrl-v     (Show/hide the animation editor. This is where I can see the keyframes assigned to a clip)
                (A keyframe is indicated by a diamond)
                (Stacked diamonds indicate more than one parameter has been adjusted at this keyframe)

-- a: returns to the selection arrow, for example after using the blade tool
-- Cmd-Comma: Display the preferences window

-- An orange bar at the bottom of a clip is called the used clip indicator

-- Shift-z: Fit all clips to the timeline (if the timeline is enabled)
-- Shift-z: Fit the image to the window (if I clicked inside the viewer)


Copy clip (or selected portion of clip) from primary storyline to b-roll:
-- Select the clip
-- Cmd-c to copy
-- Opt-v to paste into b-roll

Place clip into its own storyline:
-- Select the clip
-- Clip->Create Storyline (or Opt-g)
-- Note: A grey boundary in placed around the clip to indicate that it is now in its own storyline
-- Note: One use for this is to add a gap clip to a clip in b-roll. First add the b-roll clip to its own storyline. Then I can add the gap to the clip. You might do this to extend the length of a clip intented to be used in a drop-zone.


Match Frame:
-- Click in the timeline to set the playhead
-- Then press "Shift-f"
-- This creates a selection range in the browser spanning the clip in the timeline
-- There is a a vertical line in the browser locating the playhead position in the timeline




Connected Clips:

-- Click on the selected clip in the timeline

---- "Period" key nudges the clip right one frame
---- "Comma" key nudges the clip left one frame
---- "Shift-Period" key nudges the clip right 10 frames
---- "Shift-Comma" key nudges the clip left 10 frames
---- "v" key disables the connected clip so that I can see the clip below

-- Move the playhead over the clip

---- "x"     creates a selection range spanning the entire clip under the skimmer or playhead
---- "c"     select the clip under the skimmer or playhead
---- Select the clip and press "/" will play back the selection




Types of edits when selecting "trim" from the dropdown above the timeline:

-- ripple: Clips earlier or later in time shift based on the edit
-- rolling: Trims two sides of an edit point at once. So two clips get longer or shorter based on moving left or right
-- slip: Change the start and end frames of a single clip simultaneously
-- slide: The center clip stays the same, but the clips on either side get longer or shorter
